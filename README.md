# CWUAAT Appendix A
Digital appendix for research paper: "AID-Watch: Increasing Time Processing Ability in Adolescents With Cognitive Impairments" for Cambridge Workshop on Universal Access and Assistive Technology (CWUAAT)

Questionnaire items for the three TPA dimensions (time orientation, timemanagement, and time perception) are inspired from the TPA measurement method ”KaTid®” [8] and [17]. Care personnel rated the items on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from ”-3 - strongly disagree” to ”3 - strongly agree”.
